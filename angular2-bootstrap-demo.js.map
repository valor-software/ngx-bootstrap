Angular application by explicitly specifying a component to use\r\n * as the root component for your application via the `bootstrap()` method.\r\n *\r\n * ## Simple Example\r\n *\r\n * Assuming this `index.html`:\r\n *\r\n * ```html\r\n * <html>\r\n *   <!-- load Angular script tags here. -->\r\n *   <body>\r\n *     <my-app>loading...</my-app>\r\n *   </body>\r\n * </html>\r\n * ```\r\n *\r\n * An application is bootstrapped inside an existing browser DOM, typically `index.html`.\r\n * Unlike Angular 1, Angular 2 does not compile/process providers in `index.html`. This is\r\n * mainly for security reasons, as well as architectural changes in Angular 2. This means\r\n * that `index.html` can safely be processed using server-side technologies such as\r\n * providers. Bindings can thus use double-curly `{{ syntax }}` without collision from\r\n * Angular 2 component double-curly `{{ syntax }}`.\r\n *\r\n * We can use this script code:\r\n *\r\n * {@example core/ts/bootstrap/bootstrap.ts region='bootstrap'}\r\n *\r\n * When the app developer invokes `bootstrap()` with the root component `MyApp` as its\r\n * argument, Angular performs the following tasks:\r\n *\r\n *  1. It uses the component's `selector` property to locate the DOM element which needs\r\n *     to be upgraded into the angular component.\r\n *  2. It creates a new child injector (from the platform injector). Optionally, you can\r\n *     also override the injector configuration for an app by invoking `bootstrap` with the\r\n *     `componentInjectableBindings` argument.\r\n *  3. It creates a new `Zone` and connects it to the angular application's change detection\r\n *     domain instance.\r\n *  4. It creates an emulated or shadow DOM on the selected component's host element and loads the\r\n *     template into it.\r\n *  5. It instantiates the specified component.\r\n *  6. Finally, Angular performs change detection to apply the initial data providers for the\r\n *     application.\r\n *\r\n *\r\n * ## Bootstrapping Multiple Applications\r\n *\r\n * When working within a browser window, there are many singleton resources: cookies, title,\r\n * location, and others. Angular services that represent these resources must likewise be\r\n * shared across all Angular applications that occupy the same browser window. For this\r\n * reason, Angular creates exactly one global platform object which stores all shared\r\n * services, and each angular application injector has the platform injector as its parent.\r\n *\r\n * Each application has its own private injector as well. When there are multiple\r\n * applications on a page, Angular treats each application injector's services as private\r\n * to that application.\r\n *\r\n * ## API\r\n *\r\n * - `appComponentType`: The root component which should act as the application. This is\r\n *   a reference to a `Type` which is annotated with `@Component(...)`.\r\n * - `customProviders`: An additional set of providers that can be added to the\r\n *   app injector to override default injection behavior.\r\n *\r\n * Returns a `Promise` of {@link ComponentRef}.\r\n */\r\nfunction bootstrap(appComponentType, customProviders) {\r\n    core_1.reflector.reflectionCapabilities =

make sure to keep to edits in sync with the source file.\r\n *\r\n * Source:\r\n * https://github.com/webcomponents/webcomponentsjs/blob/4efecd7e0e/src/ShadowCSS/ShadowCSS.js\r\n *\r\n * The original file level comment is reproduced below\r\n */\r\n/*\r\n  This is a limited shim for ShadowDOM css styling.\r\n  https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/webcomponents/raw-file/tip/spec/shadow/index.html#styles\r\n\r\n  The intention here is to support only the styling features which can be\r\n  relatively simply implemented. The goal is to allow users to avoid the\r\n  most obvious pitfalls and do so without compromising performance significantly.\r\n  For ShadowDOM styling that's not covered here, a set of best practices\r\n  can be provided that should allow users to accomplish more complex styling.\r\n\r\n  The following is a list of specific ShadowDOM styling features and a brief\r\n  discussion of the approach used to shim.\r\n\r\n  Shimmed features:\r\n\r\n  * :host, :host-context: ShadowDOM allows styling of the shadowRoot's host\r\n  element using the :host rule. To shim this feature, the :host styles are\r\n  reformatted and prefixed with a given scope name and promoted to a\r\n  document level stylesheet.\r\n  For example, given a scope name of .foo, a rule like this:\r\n\r\n    :host {\r\n        background: red;\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n  becomes:\r\n\r\n    .foo {\r\n      background: red;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n  * encapsultion: Styles defined within ShadowDOM, apply only to\r\n  dom inside the ShadowDOM. Polymer uses one of two techniques to implement\r\n  this feature.\r\n\r\n  By default, rules are prefixed with the host element tag name\r\n  as a descendant selector. This ensures styling does not leak out of the 'top'\r\n  of the element's ShadowDOM. For example,\r\n\r\n  div {\r\n      font-weight: bold;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n  becomes:\r\n\r\n  x-foo div {\r\n      font-weight: bold;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n  becomes:\r\n\r\n\r\n  Alternatively, if WebComponents.ShadowCSS.strictStyling is set to true then\r\n  selectors are scoped by adding an attribute selector suffix to each\r\n  simple selector that contains the host element tag name. Each element\r\n  in the element's ShadowDOM template is also given the scope attribute.\r\n  Thus, these rules match only elements that have the scope attribute.\r\n  For example, given a scope name of x-foo, a rule like this:\r\n\r\n    div {\r\n      font-weight: bold;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n  becomes:\r\n\r\n    div[x-foo] {\r\n      font-weight: bold;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n  Note that elements that are dynamically added to a scope must have the scope\r\n  selector added to them manually.\r\n\r\n  * upper/lower bound encapsulation: Styles which are defined outside a\r\n  shadowRoot should not cross the ShadowDOM boundary and should not apply\r\n  inside a shadowRoot.\r\n\r\n  This styling behavior is not emulated. Some possible ways to do this that\r\n  were rejected due to complexity and/or performance concerns include: (1) reset\r\n  every possible property for every possible selector for a given scope name;\r\n  (2) re-implement css in javascript.\r\n\r\n  As an alternative, users should make sure to use selectors\r\n  specific to the scope in which they are working.\r\n\r\n  * ::distributed: This behavior is not emulated. It's often not necessary\r\n  to style the contents of a specific insertion point and instead, descendants\r\n  of the host element can be styled selectively. Users can also create an\r\n  extra node around an insertion point and style that node's contents\r\n  via descendent selectors. For example, with a shadowRoot like this:\r\n\r\n    <style>\r\n      ::content(div) {\r\n        background: red;\r\n      }\r\n    </style>\r\n    <content></content>\r\n\r\n  could become:\r\n\r\n    <style>\r\n      / *@polyfill .content-container div * /\r\n      ::content(div) {\r\n        background: red;\r\n      }\r\n    </style>\r\n    <div class=\"content-container\">\r\n      <content></content>\r\n    </div>\r\n\r\n  Note the use of @polyfill in the comment above a ShadowDOM specific style\r\n  declaration. This is a directive to the styling shim to use the selector\r\n  in comments in lieu of the next selector when running under polyfill.\r\n*/\r\nvar ShadowCss = (function () {\r\n    function ShadowCss() {\r\n        this.strictStyling = true;\r\n    }\r\n    /*\r\n    * Shim some cssText with the given selector.
