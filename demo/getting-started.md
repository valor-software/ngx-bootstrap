# Getting started

### Dependencies
This module consists of native Angular2 components and directives, no jQuery or Bootstrap javascript is required.

Always actual list of JS dependencies you can find [here](https://david-dm.org/valor-software/ng2-bootstrap)

Plus this module plays nice with Bootstrap CSS [v3](http://getbootstrap.com/css/) and [v4](http://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com)

*Note* later on each component will be available independently via npm, jspm, etc.

### Installation

```bash
npm install --save ng2-bootstrap
```



Have fun!

### Reading documentation

Each `ng2-bootstrap` component has api and annotation docs, examples and working demo. Each `property` and `event` has type annotation and default value if any.
