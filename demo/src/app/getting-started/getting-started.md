# ng2-bootstrap  [![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/ng2-bootstrap.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/js/ng2-bootstrap) [![npm downloads](https://img.shields.io/npm/dm/ng2-bootstrap.svg)](https://npmjs.org/ng2-bootstrap)[![Angular 2 Style Guide](https://mgechev.github.io/angular2-style-guide/images/badge.svg)](https://angular.io/styleguide)

Here you will find all [Twitter Bootstrap](http://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com) components plus
many more useful components like: date picker, time picker, rating, typeahead, etc.

Additionally to allow reach experience while working with Dates we are using [moment.js](http://momentjs.com/), de facto best date manipulation library at the moment.

This module plays nice with Bootstrap CSS [v3](http://getbootstrap.com/css/) and [v4](http://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com)

## Installation instructions

You don't need to include original JS components, but we are using markup and css provided by Bootstrap.

```bash
npm install ng2-bootstrap --save
