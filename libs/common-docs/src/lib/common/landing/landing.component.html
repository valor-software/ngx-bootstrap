            <h4>Flexible</h4>
            <p>We put much effort making ngx-bootstrap modular so that you can implement own templates, styles, whatnot. All components are designed with extensibility and adaptivity in mind. You can expect them to work on Mobile and Desktop with the same level of performance.</p>
